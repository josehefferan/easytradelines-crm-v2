        <p>This Agreement is entered into on the _____ day of _____________, 2025, by and between Smart Latinos Consulting Group, doing business as Easy Tradelines, hereinafter referred to as "Easy Tradelines", and ________________________________, whose address is ____________________________________________, hereinafter called "Card Holder".</p>

        <h3>1. PURPOSE OF THE AGREEMENT</h3>
        <p>Easy Tradelines and Card Holder have entered into this Agreement to set forth the terms and conditions under which Easy Tradelines will facilitate a third-party's (the "Third-Party") temporary designation on the Card Holder's credit lines/trade-lines as an authorized user for the sole purpose of attempting to increase the Third-Party's FICO score.</p>
        <p>Cardholder hereby agrees to be bound to the following terms and conditions regarding all services rendered by Easy Tradelines.</p>

        <h3>2. SERVICES</h3>
        <p>Easy Tradelines will perform the following services under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Easy Tradelines will use its best efforts to establish relationships between Cardholder and Third-Parties based on its review of the creditworthiness of the Cardholder and the credit enhancement sought by Third-Parties. The decision of Tradeline Score to match any Third-Party with the Cardholder shall be within the sole and exclusive discretion of Easy Tradelines, and Easy Tradelines makes no representation, actual or implied, that any Third-Party will be presented to Cardholder for its consideration to be added as an authorized user on any tradelines made available by the Cardholder pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
        <p>Easy Tradelines will make an independent review of the Cardholder's creditworthiness and available trade-lines for purposes of: (i) determining whether the addition of a Third-Party to these tradelines is likely to have a positive effect on the Third-Party's FICO score; (ii) assessing the value of the Cardholder's agreement to make a tradeline available to a Third-Party; and (iii) providing Cardholder with the appropriate information from a Third-Party so as to enable the Cardholder to add these third-parties as additional authorized users of such trade-lines.</p>

        <h3>3. COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES</h3>
        <p><strong>Easy Tradeline Card Holders covenants, represents and warrants the following:</strong></p>
        <p>Cardholder shall provide all information requested by Easy Tradelines and that all such information is true, complete and correct in all respects.</p>
        <p>Cardholder authorizes Easy Tradelines to obtain from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, or any their respective affiliates (together, the "Credit Bureaus"), and, if necessary, from their respective subscribers, all credit and transaction information regarding Cardholder's credit history, credit transactions of record, and credit scores. This information may include, but is not necessarily limited to, review of credit reports, credit history, credit files, credit transactions and any other credit-related record.</p>
        <p>Cardholder represents, warrants and agrees that he/she shall not attempt to contact nor have any direct contact with any Third-Party. If Cardholder is contacted directly by any Third-Party, Cardholder shall not communicate with the Third-Party and shall immediately contact Easy Tradelines advising them of the contact.</p>
        <p>Cardholder acknowledges that all information provided to it by Easy Tradelines with respect to a Third-Party is confidential, and Cardholder agrees that it shall keep all such information confidential by taking appropriate measures to ensure against the unauthorized release or reproduction of or access to the information and to destroy or return to Easy Tradelines such information as soon as practicable after the Third-Party has been added as an additional authorized user of the applicable tradeline. In the event that Cardholder receives any request for information provided to it by Easy Tradelines by means of a subpoena or other valid legal process, the Cardholder shall not provide any such information without and until it has notified Easy Tradelines of the request in writing at least five (5) business days before responding to such request by providing the information.</p>
        <p>Cardholder shall promptly notify Easy Tradelines of any material change in its name or contact information, including, but not limited to, any change in telephone numbers, mail addresses, or email addresses.</p>
        <p>Cardholder shall promptly notify Easy Tradelines of any material change to its tradelines, including, but not limited to, any changes in payment due dates, credit limits, or outstanding balances on these trade-lines. In addition, Cardholder shall promptly notify Tradeline Score of any event of default, or other event, that if not cured within the terms and conditions of any trade-line, would constitute an event of default under any trade-line.</p>
        <p>For so long as any Third-Party is an authorized user of any tradeline, Cardholder agrees that it will maintain an outstanding balance on the tradeline that is less than 10% of the maximum credit made available by the lender under such tradeline, and that it will make timely payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tradeline.</p>
        <p>Cardholder shall add a Third-Party as an authorized user to the applicable tradeline within 48 hours of receiving all information from Tradeline Score. Unless a different time period is requested by Easy Tradelines, Cardholder agrees to keep Third-Party as an authorized user on its tradeline for a minimum of one-billing cycle or thirty (30) days.</p>
        <p>Cardholder shall not provide a Third-Party with the ability to access the trade-line in any manner, including, but not limited to, by providing a check, credit card, an account number, or any authorization code.</p>
        <p>For so long as this Agreement is in effect, Cardholder shall not enter into any agreement authorizing the use of the tradeline by any party other than a Third-Party without obtaining the prior written consent of Easy Tradelines.</p>
        <p>Cardholder shall rely solely on the information provided by Easy Tradelines in authorizing a Third-Party as an additional user of the tradeline, and shall not undertake any independent review of or make any request for information regarding the Third-Party, without obtaining the prior written consent of Easy Tradelines.</p>

        <p>Easy Tradelines shall not provide a TS Third-Party with the ability to access a Cardholder's tradeline in any manner, including, but not limited to, by providing any credit card numbers, account numbers, or any authorization code(s).</p>
        <p>Easy Tradelines is not a credit repair company in that it does not attempt to correct inaccurate information on behalf of the Third-Party, does not submit or attempt to resolve disputes on behalf of the Client, and does not attempt to improve a client's credit record or history.</p>

        <h3>4. COMPENSATION</h3>
        <p>In exchange for Cardholder's agreement to add a Third-Party as an authorized user of any trade-line, Cardholder shall receive a fee in an amount to be determined by Easy Tradelines.

        <p><strong>4.2</strong> No fee shall be paid to the Cardholder for its agreement to add a Third-Party to a tradeline until and unless the addition of the Third-Party as an authorized user of the Cardholder's trade-line has been reflected on the credit report of the Third-Party issued by Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union.</p>

        <h3>5. TIME FOR PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES</h3>

        <p>This Agreement shall continue until such time as it is terminated by either party.

        <h3>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
