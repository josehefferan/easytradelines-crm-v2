            <p>Easy Tradelines will perform the following services under this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Easy Tradelines will use its best efforts to establish relationships between Cardholder and Third-Parties based on its review of the creditworthiness of the Cardholder and the credit enhancement sought by Third-Parties. The decision of Easy Tradelines to match any Third-Party with the Cardholder shall be within the sole and exclusive discretion of Easy Tradelines, and Easy Tradelines makes no representation, actual or implied, that any Third-Party will be presented to Cardholder for its consideration to be added as an authorized user on any tradelines made available by the Cardholder pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Easy Tradelines will make an independent review of the Cardholder's creditworthiness and available trade-lines for purposes of: (i) determining whether the addition of a Third-Party to these tradelines is likely to have a positive effect on the Third-Party's FICO score; (ii) assessing the value of the Cardholder's agreement to make a tradeline available to a Third-Party; and (iii) providing Cardholder with the appropriate information from a Third-Party so as to enable the Cardholder to add these third-parties as additional authorized users of such trade-lines.</p>

            <p>Cardholder represents, warrants and agrees that he/she shall not attempt to contact nor have any direct contact with any Third-Party. If Cardholder is contacted directly by any Third-Party, Cardholder shall not communicate with the Third-Party and shall immediately contact Easy Tradelines advising them of the contact.</p>
            <p>Cardholder acknowledges that all information provided to it by Easy Tradelines with respect to a Third-Party is confidential, and Cardholder agrees that it shall keep all such information confidential by taking appropriate measures to ensure against the unauthorized release or reproduction of or access to the information.</p>
            <p>Cardholder shall promptly notify Easy Tradelines of any material change in its name or contact information, including, but not limited to, any change in telephone numbers, mail addresses, or email addresses.</p>
            <p>Cardholder shall promptly notify Easy Tradelines of any material change to its tradelines, including, but not limited to, any changes in payment due dates, credit limits, or outstanding balances on these trade-lines.</p>

            <p>Cardholder shall add a Third-Party as an authorized user to the applicable tradeline within 48 hours of receiving all information from Easy Tradelines. Unless a different time period is requested by Easy Tradelines, Cardholder agrees to keep Third-Party as an authorized user on its tradeline for a minimum of one-billing cycle or thirty (30) days.</p>
            <p>Cardholder shall not provide a Third-Party with the ability to access the trade-line in any manner, including, but not limited to, by providing a check, credit card, an account number, or any authorization code.</p>
            <p>For so long as this Agreement is in effect, Cardholder shall not enter into any agreement authorizing the use of the tradeline by any party other than a Third-Party without obtaining the prior written consent of Easy Tradelines.</p>
            <p>Cardholder shall rely solely on the information provided by Easy Tradelines in authorizing a Third-Party as an additional user of the tradeline, and shall not undertake any independent review of or make any request for information regarding the Third-Party, without obtaining the prior written consent of Easy Tradelines.</p>
